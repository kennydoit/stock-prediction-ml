    "# Experimental Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains experimental code for sentiment analysis that was removed from the main feature engineering pipeline due to API limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Limitations\n",
    "- NewsAPI free tier only provides 30 days of historical data\n",
    "- Paid API access is cost-prohibitive\n",
    "- Rate limits and pagination issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work\n",
    "- Evaluate alternative news sources\n",
    "- Implement web scraping\n",
    "- Consider social media sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Original Code\n",
    "The original sentiment analysis code has been preserved in the `src/features/sentiment/` directory for future reference when implementing alternative approaches."
